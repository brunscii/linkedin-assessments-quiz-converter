# linkedin-assessments-quiz-converter
## Description
This is a small project that aims to convert the linkedin assessments that are stored in MD format. The tests are stored in a well maintained [repo by Ebazhanov](https://github.com/Ebazhanov/linkedin-skill-assessments-quizzes.git)

Right now this is a work in progress. I am exploring the conversion of markdown in jQuery using the marked library. Eventually I plan on converting this to a react app that will be modular.
Ideally you should be able to load any MD style quiz of a similar format and be given a quiz.

I also experimented with converting the markdown with python to generate a static html test for each MD file. This would be a neat alternative as a conversion program
